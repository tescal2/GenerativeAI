**In-context learning for Natural Language Understanding with Cohere Medium Large Language Model**

This tutorial focuses on utilizing the Cohere Medium foundation model to achieve in-context learning. This involves leveraging the model's natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities to personalize user's responses and improve their performance. You will learn step-by-step how to perform NLU tasks using Cohere Medium. Specifically, you will learn how to engineer prompts that enable Cohere Medium to learn in-context and improve its performance, such as identifying named entities via few-shot learning. This will enhance the model's ability to infer context and answer questions, providing better responses to the user.
