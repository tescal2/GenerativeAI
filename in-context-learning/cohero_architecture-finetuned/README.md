Cohero Architecture is a prompt generation model used to feed text2img models such as Stable Difussion or Midjourney.

The Cohereo Architecture is a product of an early collaboration with Cohere in 2022. It is a finetuned model based of their generate model using purely architecture prompts as a training dataset. Their early playground UI allowed only for .txt datasets and such was crowd sourced from online contributions. 

Previous efforts of finetuning the model using just a few dozen prompts on other topics yeidled fairly good results as well. Depending on the undelying infrastrucutre, training jobs take only minutes to create an instrucuted LLM.
